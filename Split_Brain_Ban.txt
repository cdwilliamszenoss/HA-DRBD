1. Verify that auto promote is set disabled
   Use Unicast instead of Mulitcast for corosync if nodes are not in sync.

   Set role on each node:
   drbdadm primary dfs-resource --force
   drbdadm secondary dfs-resource

3. Stop drbd services on both nodes

4. Bring down resource on both nodes 'drbdadm down dfs-resource'

5. Recreate the resources on the backup node 'drbdadm create-md dfs-resource'

6. Bring up resource on both nodes. Set primary first.
   Primary:
   drbdadm primary dfs-resource --force

   Secondary:
   drbdadm seconday dfs-resource

7. Check to see if services are connected
   drbdadm status

   drbdadm connect dfs-resource
